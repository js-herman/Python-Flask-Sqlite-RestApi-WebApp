## Development Cycle In Agile Methodology

1. MEETING
   - Define The Requirements
   
2. DEFINE THE PROJECT
   - [Create The Project Charter](DevOps/projectCharter.pdf)
   
3. USER STORIES
   - [Define User Types](DevOps/chart.jpeg)
   - Define Epics
   - Define Non-functional Issues: Security, Performance ...
   - User stories must match with component size and they must be mapped to epics.
   - [A use case for each epic](DevOps/useCase.png)

4. EARLY SYSTEM MODELS
   - [Conceptual model](DevOps/dataFlow.png)
   - [Flow diagrams - One diagram for each use case , you can use a flowchart or business process model](DevOps/secondFlowChart.PNG)

5. FIRST SPRINT
   - [Mockups Unit Test related to User Stories](DevOps/mockups.bmpr)
   
6. MEETING
   - Make a customer meeting to show to development process and check requirements again.
   - Make some commits.
  
7. DATA MODEL
   - [Create ER diagrams for DB](DevOps/erDiagram.png)
   
8. SOFTWARE MODEL
   - [System Architecture](https://github.com/uysalemre/CastAgencyWebApp/blob/master/DevOps/System%20Architecture.png)
   - [Component Diagram](DevOps/componentDiagram.jpeg)
   - [Sequence Diagram](DevOps/communicationDiagram.PNG)
   
9. SECOND and THIRD SPRINT
   - Change Logs for First Sprint
   - [Mockups for Unit Tests](DevOps/unit%20test%20mockups/)
